# ***What is Algorithm?***

### *The algorithm is a set of rules to be followed to solve a problem. We can exemplify the algorithm as a recipe for something, it is necessary to describe the materials, the way of doing it and the different ways to achieve the result of the recipe. That's why when coding it is necessary to clearly define what you want your program to do, as it comprises a finite sequence, that is, it has a beginning, middle and end. The algorithm is not the program itself but the sequence of actions and conditions that must be met in order for the problem to be solved. An algorithm can be executed by a computer or by another type of automaton such as an electromechanical machine. algorithm is using the flowchart, which is a schematic and visual representation of the algorithm, usually in graphic form illustrating all the steps to be followed. An algorithm must encompass all possible scenarios for solving the problem.* :computer:
